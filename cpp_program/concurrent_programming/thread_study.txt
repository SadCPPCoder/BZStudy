Create thread
    we can use std::thread in <thread> header to create a thread, and the thread
    will start immediately after the object created. And if create thread failed.
    the creator will throw an excption std::system_error.

Thread finish
    When the main function finished, and the thread has not been joined or detached,
    the program will stop immediately and call std::terminate().
    If we join the thread, then main thread will wait until the thread finished.
    And if we detach a thread, then it will be stopped forcibly after main() finished.
    And we should pay attention to the detached thread, because it may access the 
    local or global or static resource when the program destroies them.
