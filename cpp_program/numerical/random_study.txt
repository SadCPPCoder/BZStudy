# description: record the study node of random in C++11

To generate a random number in C++11, we need two components. One is random engine, and 
the other one is distribution.
1. random engine
    Random engine is the source of random number. And there are several random engines
    in C++11, the one which we use mostly is std::default_random_engine, this may satisfied
    our nomal reqirments.
2. distribution
    We can use distribution to distribute the number that comes from random engine, and
    meet our own distribution requirments, for ex, uniform or normal?
    There are several distribution models, too. We can pick the model by our requirement.

3. generate random number
    If we use the same random engine and same distribution, there will be same number 
    sequence of random number. It means that each time we run our program, it will output
    the same numbers from the distribution, absolutely, this is not what we want.
    So, we should use some random number as a seed to input to the engine, then the
    engine can output different number sequence. For ex, time duration between two click
    events, or current system clock.
    Usually, I like to use system clock.

    auto time_count = duration_cast<millisenconds>(system_clock::now().time_since_epoch())
    std::default_random_engine(time_count);
